## 🧭 Overview

### 💡 The Challenge

The challenge was to build a responsive **blog preview card** that matches the design provided by Frontend Mentor.  
Users should be able to view the component’s layout on different screen sizes, from **mobile (375px)** to **desktop (1440px)**.

The main focus areas were:
- Creating a clean, centered layout  
- Making the design responsive  
- Using semantic HTML for accessibility  
- Applying a pleasant color scheme and shadow effects

## 🛠️ My Process

### ⚙️ Built With

- **HTML5**  
- **Tailwind CSS**  
- **Flexbox** for layout  
- **Mobile-first workflow**  

---

### 🧠 What I Learned

During this project, I practiced:

- Structuring **clean and accessible HTML**  
- Using **Tailwind utility classes** to style and center elements quickly  
- Creating a **responsive and visually appealing card design**  
- Applying **box shadows**, **rounded corners**, and **spacing utilities**  
- Designing with a **mobile-first approach**

Here’s an example snippet I used to center the card perfectly:
```html
<body class="min-h-screen bg-[#f4d04e] flex justify-center items-center">


🔮 Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to:

Add subtle hover animations for better interactivity

Implement dark mode support

Customize Tailwind configuration for reusable themes and color palettes
